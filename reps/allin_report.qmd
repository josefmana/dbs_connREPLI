In this report I present results of the first few sets of predictions of (one-year) post-surgery changes in measures of **cognitive performance** (assessed via *Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, second edition, DRS-2*), **mood** (assessed via *Beck Depression Inventory, second edition, BDI-II*), **anxiety** (assessed via *State-trait anxiety inventory, STAIX1* for *state* and *STAIX2* for *trait anxiety*), and **motor symptoms** (assessed via *Movement Disorder Society's Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, MDS-UPDRS, part III*) as a function of VAT-based overlaps with (dis)favourable (f)MRI maps derived from previous research.

>The report is divided to sections according into the type of prediction that was used starting with fMRI-connectivity-based predictions from Clemens, then multivariate-model-based predictions of non-motor symptoms from Garance, followed by multiple types of predictions of motor symptoms from Patricia, and finished by symptom-specific predictions from Nanditha. In each section, number of subjects is reported together with (Spearman's Rho) correlation matrix where correlations between clinical outcomes and (f)MRI-derived predictions are delineated by a red rectangle. Correlations with (bootstrapped) p < .05 (without further adjustment of p-values) are marked by presence of a coloured circle whereby colour and size of the circle indicate direction and strength of the correlation respectively. On the other, correlations with p > .05 are represent by text only.

## Analysed variables

::: {.callout-note}
All clinical outcomes are being represented as **gain scores** whereby each gain score is calculated as *"score_after_dbs-minus-score_before_dbs"* and scaled in such a way that **higher** and **positive** gain scores correspond to **worsening** of symptoms one year after DBS surgery compared to their pre-surgery level.
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
All MDS-UPDRS III gain scores are calculated by subtracting pre-surgery scores sampled in **OFF-medication** condition from (one year) post-surgery sampled in **ON-stimulation/OFF-medication** condition.
:::

:::{.callout-tip}
@tbl-voc presents mapping of variables (left column) from the data set to their labels (right column) as presented in correlation matrices.
