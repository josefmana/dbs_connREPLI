In this report I present results of the first few sets of predictions of (one-year) post-surgery changes in measures of **cognitive performance** (assessed via *Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, second edition, DRS-2*), **mood** (assessed via *Beck Depression Inventory, second edition, BDI-II*), **anxiety** (assessed via *State-trait anxiety inventory, STAIX1* for *state* and *STAIX2* for *trait anxiety*), and **motor symptoms** (assessed via *Movement Disorder Society's Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, MDS-UPDRS, part III*) as a function of VAT-based overlaps with (dis)favourable (f)MRI maps derived from previous research.

>The report is divided to sections according into the type of prediction that was used starting with fMRI-connectivity-based predictions from Clemens, then multivariate-model-based predictions of non-motor symptoms from Garance, followed by multiple types of predictions of motor symptoms from Patricia, and finished by symptom-specific predictions from Nanditha. In each section, number of subjects is reported together with (Spearman's Rho) correlation matrix where correlations between clinical outcomes and (f)MRI-derived predictions are delineated by a red rectangle. Correlations with (bootstrapped) p < .05 (without further adjustment of p-values) are marked by presence of a coloured circle whereby colour and size of the circle indicate direction and strength of the correlation respectively. On the other, correlations with p > .05 are represent by text only.

## Analysed variables

::: {.callout-note}
All clinical outcomes are being represented as **gain scores** whereby each gain score is calculated as *"score_after_dbs-minus-score_before_dbs"* and scaled in such a way that **higher** and **positive** gain scores correspond to **worsening** of symptoms one year after DBS surgery compared to their pre-surgery level.
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
All MDS-UPDRS III gain scores are calculated by subtracting pre-surgery scores sampled in **OFF-medication** condition from (one year) post-surgery sampled in **ON-stimulation/OFF-medication** condition.

## Full correlation matrix

:::{.callout-note}
Below I present a (Spearman's Rho) correlation matrix of all included variables (with LEDD gain added) to show overall correlation pattern. In @fig-full all correlations are compute via a pairwise complete case approach to missing values.

## Potential to add patients

:::{.callout-tip}
Finally, I present number of patients that have their *postop-minus-preop* clinical data available in our database but were not included yet. These numbers represent the upper bound estimate of the number of patient which could be in principle added to the data set (if their MRI and CT data is available).
